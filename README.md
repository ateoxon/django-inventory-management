# goodSamaritanIMS
A Django application where non-profit food pantries and restaurants meet

Part of the Good Samaritan Application - 


Creating an inventory system where food pantries (the consumer) and restaurants/grocery stores (the vendor) meet!
Vendors will upload their inventory of food or beverages available for donation, while consumers can log in, find vendor information, and reserve donations.

This IMS handles most of the back-end functionality of the app, allows admin to keep inventory of different donations.
